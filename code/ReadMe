Project 1, CS-433 Machine Learning, Autumn semester 2019, EPFL

In this project we have implemented ML methods such as Least
squares with GD, Least squares with SGD, Least squares using
normal equations, Logistic regression with SGD and Regularized
logistic regression. Later, we have used this methods on Higgs
Boson challenge.

To create the the exact same prediction we have used in our
best submission run file 'run.py' with command:
'python3 run.py path_to_train_file path_to_test_file', where
'path_to_train_file'/'path_to_test_file' corresponds to path
to train/test file in your local file system.

During the development process we have used Python 3.7 and Numpy
version 1.17.2. We strongly recommend to use this or newer
versions.

The comments in out project are following numpydoc docstring
convention (see https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).
Our code is formatted with Black (see https://github.com/psf/black).
