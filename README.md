# Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge

We  developed  a  machine  learning  algorithm  from scratch for the [Higgs Boson Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson). We implemented several common learning methods from scratch, and constructed a model using evolutionary feature selection and regularization.

This project was created as a part of Machine Learning (CS-433) class at EPFL during Autumn semester 2019 with Martin Hanzel and Rastislav Kováč.
